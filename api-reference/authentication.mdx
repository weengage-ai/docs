title: 'Authentication'

All API endpoints are authenticated using API Keys available in [Integration Settings](https://eu.volubile.ai/settings/integration) as Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer {volubile-api-key}
```

## Rotate API Keys

Volubile gives access to a pair of api keys enabling you to manage a regular rotation or replace a leaked key.
