title: 'Rate limiting'
---

The Volubile API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across all clients. Rate limits are enforced on a per-account basis, using a fixed time window and a maximum number of allowed requests within that window.

Currently, all endpoints are subject to the following rate limit:

- Per customer account: __100 requests per 15 seconds__.

## Rate Limit Response

The following headers are included with every API response:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Indicates the maximum number of requests a client can make within the rate limit window.
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Shows the number of requests remaining before the limit is reached.

If a client exceeds the rate limit, the API will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code. In this case, the `Retry-After` header is included, indicating the number of seconds the client should wait before making another request to avoid being rate-limited.
